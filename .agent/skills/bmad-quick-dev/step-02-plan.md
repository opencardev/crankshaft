# Step 2: Plan

## RULES

- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- No intermediate approvals.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Draft resume check. If `{spec_file}` exists with `status: draft`, read it and capture the verbatim `<frozen-after-approval>...</frozen-after-approval>` block as `preserved_intent`. Otherwise `preserved_intent` is empty.
2. Investigate codebase. _Isolate deep exploration in subagents/tasks where available. To prevent context snowballing, instruct subagents to give you distilled summaries only._
3. Read `./spec-template.md` fully. Fill it out based on the intent and investigation. If `{preserved_intent}` is non-empty, substitute it for the `<frozen-after-approval>` block in your filled spec before writing. Write the result to `{spec_file}`.
4. Self-review against READY FOR DEVELOPMENT standard.
5. If intent gaps exist, do not fantasize, do not leave open questions, HALT and ask the human.
6. Token count check (see SCOPE STANDARD). If spec exceeds 1600 tokens:
   - Show user the token count.
   - HALT and ask human: `[S] Split — carve off secondary goals` | `[K] Keep full spec — accept the risks`
   - On **S**: Propose the split — name each secondary goal. For each deferred goal, append one new entry to `{deferred_work_file}` using this format. Do not modify existing entries or look for duplicates. Rewrite the current spec to cover only the main goal — do not surgically carve sections out; regenerate the spec for the narrowed scope. Continue to checkpoint.
     ```markdown
     - source_spec: `{spec_file}`
       summary: <one sentence naming the deferred goal>
       evidence: <why this was split from the current spec>
     ```
   - On **K**: Continue to checkpoint with full spec.

### CHECKPOINT 1

Present summary. Display the spec file path as a CWD-relative path (no leading `/`) so it is clickable in the terminal. If token count exceeded 1600 and user chose [K], include the token count and explain why it may be a problem.

After presenting the summary, display this note:

Before approving, you can open the spec file in an editor or ask me questions and tell me what to change. You can also use `bmad-advanced-elicitation`, `bmad-party-mode`, or `bmad-code-review` skills, ideally in another session to avoid context bloat.

---

HALT and ask human: `[A] Approve` | `[E] Edit`

- **A**: Re-read `{spec_file}` from disk.
  - **If the file is missing:** HALT. Tell the user the spec file is gone and STOP — do not write anything to `{spec_file}`, do not set status, do not proceed to Step 3. Nothing below this point runs.
  - **If the file exists:** Compare the content to what you wrote. If it has changed since you wrote it, acknowledge the external edits — show a brief summary of what changed — and proceed with the updated version. Then set status `ready-for-dev` in `{spec_file}`. Everything inside `<frozen-after-approval>` is now locked — only the human can change it. → Step 3.
- **E**: Apply changes, then return to CHECKPOINT 1.
