# NFR Evidence Audit - Validation Checklist

**Workflow:** `testarch-nfr`
**Purpose:** Ensure comprehensive evidence-based NFR audit with actionable recommendations

---

Note: `nfr-assess` is the NFR Evidence Audit. It evaluates existing implementation evidence; it does not run tests or CI workflows. Use `test-design` to plan NFR thresholds and evidence before implementation.

## Prerequisites Validation

- [ ] Evidence sources are available (test results, metrics, logs, CI results)
- [ ] NFR categories are determined (performance, security, reliability, maintainability, custom)
- [ ] Evidence directories exist and are accessible (`test_results_dir`, `metrics_dir`, `logs_dir`)
- [ ] Knowledge base is loaded (nfr-criteria, ci-burn-in, test-quality)

---

## Context Loading

- [ ] Tech-spec.md loaded successfully (if available)
