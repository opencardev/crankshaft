## Decision

**Recommendation**: {Approve | Approve with Comments | Request Changes | Block}

**Rationale**:
{1-2 paragraph explanation of recommendation based on findings}

**For Approve**:

> Test quality is excellent/good with {score}/100 score. {Minor issues noted can be addressed in follow-up PRs.} Tests are production-ready and follow best practices.

**For Approve with Comments**:

> Test quality is acceptable with {score}/100 score. {High-priority recommendations should be addressed but don't block merge.} Critical issues resolved, but improvements would enhance maintainability.

**For Request Changes**:

> Test quality needs improvement with {score}/100 score. {Critical issues must be fixed before merge.} {X} critical violations detected that pose flakiness/maintainability risks.

**For Block**:

> Test quality is insufficient with {score}/100 score. {Multiple critical issues make tests unsuitable for production.} Recommend pairing session with QA engineer to apply patterns from knowledge base.
