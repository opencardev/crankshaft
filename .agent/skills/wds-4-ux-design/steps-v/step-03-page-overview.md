# Step 3: Validate Page Overview

## STEP GOAL:

Verify that page specification includes strategic context through page description, User Situation, and Page Purpose sections.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design expertise and systematic thinking, user brings product vision and domain knowledge
- ✅ Maintain creative and thoughtful tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on validating strategic context — WHY before HOW
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip User Situation or Page Purpose validation
- 💬 Approach: Check for meaningful strategic content, not just presence
- 📋 Page Overview connects design decisions to user needs and trigger map

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Validate page description, User Situation, and Page Purpose sections
- 💾 Update page specification if fixes are approved by user
- 📖 Reference Trigger Map for user context validation
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to accept empty or placeholder content as valid

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Page specification, Trigger Map, Product Brief
- Focus: Strategic context validation only
- Limits: Do not validate navigation or page sections
- Dependencies: Page specification must exist

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Check Page Overview Sections

Check for page description paragraph immediately after navigation section. Verify "User Situation" and "Page Purpose" sections exist with meaningful content.

Validate:
- Page description paragraph (1-2 paragraphs explaining what page does)
- User Situation section (user's context, needs, emotional state)
- Page Purpose section (what job page must accomplish)
- Success criteria or Trigger Map reference
- Emotional context and pain points addressed

### 2. Generate Diagnostic Report

If overview sections are missing, report as CRITICAL. If content is too brief or lacks strategic context, report as WARNING.

Generate diagnostic report showing what's missing or insufficient, provide examples of strong overview content, and explain why strategic context matters.

### 3. Resolve Issues

If issues found, present to user and ask if they want you to add/improve the overview content.

### 4. Record Validation Result

```yaml
page_overview_validated:
  description_paragraph_present: [true/false]
  user_situation_section_present: [true/false]
  page_purpose_section_present: [true/false]
  emotional_context_included: [true/false]
  success_criteria_defined: [true/false]
  strategic_intent_clear: [true/false]
  status: [pass/warning/critical]
```

### 5. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Validate Page Sections | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#5-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user selects an option from the menu and the page overview validation is complete will you proceed to the next step or return as directed.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Page description paragraph validated
- User Situation section validated with meaningful content
- Page Purpose section validated with meaningful content
- Strategic context assessed for quality (not just presence)
- Diagnostic report generated
- Issues resolved with user approval

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Accepting empty or placeholder content as valid
- Skipping User Situation or Page Purpose validation
- Not assessing content quality and strategic depth
- Auto-fixing issues without user approval
- Proceeding without recording validation result

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
