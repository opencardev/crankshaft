# Figma Integration - Summary

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026  
**Version:** WDS v6  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## Overview

This integration enables bidirectional workflow between code and Figma for design system development and visual refinement.

### Bidirectional Workflow

```
Code ⇄ Figma
```

**Two Main Workflows:**

1. **Code to Figma (C2F):** Send code implementations to Figma for visual documentation and refinement
2. **Figma to Code (F2C):** Import design specifications from Figma to generate or update code

**Key Innovation:** Specification-driven approach ensures design-code parity through shared OBJECT IDs, enabling traceability and consistency across both directions.

---

## Workshop Structure

### Code to Figma (C2F) Workshop
**Location:** `code-to-figma/`

**Purpose:** Send code implementations to Figma for design review, documentation, and visual iteration

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Connection Check - Verify html.to.design MCP server
2. Identify Type - Determine export scenario (prototype page, design system component, or frontend view)
3. Prepare Specifications - Find or create OBJECT IDs for proper Figma layer naming
4. Generate & Validate - Create Figma-compatible HTML with validation
5. Send to Figma - Execute export and verify success

**Key Features:**
- Specification-driven OBJECT ID naming
- Three export scenarios with specific ID patterns
- Automated validation before export
- Reverse engineering for missing specifications

---

### Figma to Code (F2C) Workshop
**Location:** `figma-to-code/`

**Status:** Coming Soon

**Purpose:** Import design specifications from Figma to generate or update code implementations

**Planned Workflow:**
1. Connection Check - Verify Figma Desktop MCP server
2. Select Figma Node - Identify what to import
3. Extract Design Specs - Get colors, spacing, typography, layout
4. Generate/Update Code - Create or update components
5. Verify Implementation - Compare code output to Figma design

## Core Concepts

### The Missing Dimension

**Before:** WDS created specifications and functional prototypes, but visual design creation was manual

**After:** WDS now supports iterative visual refinement through Figma extraction

### Design System Evolution

**Key Principle:** Design system grows organically as prototypes are built

**Process:**
1. Create prototype with existing design system (may look basic)
2. Extract to Figma when gaps identified
3. Refine visuals and create missing components
4. Update design system with new tokens/components
5. Re-render prototype with enhanced design system
6. Iterate until polished

### When to Extract

**Extract when:**
- Design system is incomplete
- Prototype needs visual polish
- New components required
- Stakeholder presentation needed

**Don't extract when:**
- Design system covers all needs
- Prototype looks sufficient
- Rapid iteration more important
- Early exploration phase

## Tool Integration

### html.to.design

**Role:** Convert HTML prototypes to Figma for visual refinement

**Process:**
1. Upload HTML prototype
2. Configure conversion options
3. Import to Figma
4. Refine design
5. Extract design system updates

**Benefits:**
- Preserves layout structure
- Converts CSS to Figma styles
- Maintains element hierarchy
- Enables visual refinement

### Area Tag System

**Role:** Precise region mapping for image-based prototypes

**Usage:**
- Map clickable regions on images
- Include Object IDs for traceability
- Extract coordinates via dev mode
- Document region mappings

**Integration:**
- Works with dev-mode.js component
- Supports image-based prototypes
- Enables precise click mapping

### Dev Mode Component

**Role:** Extract Object IDs and area coordinates from prototypes

**Features:**
- Shift + Click to copy Object IDs
- Visual highlights
- Area tag detection
- Coordinate extraction

**Benefit:** Maintains traceability through Figma extraction

## Workflow Integration

### Phase 4: UX Design

**Updated Step 4D (Prototype):**
- Create functional prototype
- Test functionality
- **NEW:** Assess visual quality
- **NEW:** Option to extract to Figma
- Continue to PRD update

### Phase 7: Design System

**New Workflow Branch:**
- Existing: Component specification → Design system
- Existing: Figma manual creation → Design system
- **NEW:** Prototype extraction → Figma → Design system

### Iteration Loop

**Complete Cycle:**
```
1. Sketch (concept)
2. Specification (detailed)
3. Prototype (functional)
4. Figma extraction (if needed)
5. Visual refinement
6. Design system update
7. Re-render prototype
8. Assess → Iterate or Complete
```
