## Strategic Challenge

**Problem:**
[What specific problem are we solving?]

Example:
"User onboarding has 60% drop-off rate. Users don't understand
the family concept and abandon during setup."

**Impact:**
[Why does this matter?]

Example:
"- 60% of new users never reach the dashboard
- Acquisition cost is wasted on users who drop off
- Growth is limited by poor onboarding
- Estimated revenue loss: $50K/month"

**Root Cause:**
[Why is this happening?]

Example:
"- 'Family' concept is unclear (Swedish cultural context)
- Too many steps feel like homework
- No sense of progress or achievement
- Value proposition not clear upfront"

---

## Why WDS Designer?

**Why bring in a linchpin designer now?**

Example:
"We need expert UX design to:
- Understand user psychology and motivation
- Redesign onboarding flow for clarity
- Balance business goals with user needs
- Improve completion rates to 80%+"

---

## Scope

**What are we changing?**

Example:
"Redesign onboarding flow (4 screens):
- Welcome screen (update copy and visuals)
- Family setup (simplify and clarify concept)
- Dog addition (make it optional for MVP)
- Success state (add celebration and next steps)"

**What are we NOT changing?**

Example:
"- Tech stack: React Native + Supabase (already built)
- Brand: Colors and logo are fixed
- Other features: Only touch onboarding
- Timeline: 2 weeks to design + implement"

---

## Success Criteria

**How will we measure success?**

Example:
"- Onboarding completion rate > 80% (from 40%)
- Time to complete < 2 minutes
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- 30-day retention > 60%"

---

## Constraints

**What can't we change?**

Example:
"- Tech stack: React Native + Supabase
- Brand: Colors, logo, typography fixed
- Timeline: 2 weeks total
- Budget: No additional development resources
- Scope: Only onboarding, don't touch dashboard"

---

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Design + Specifications
**Week 2:** Implementation + Validation

## Improvement Opportunity Template

**File:** `improvements/IMP-XXX-description.md`

```markdown
# Improvement: [Short Description]

**ID:** IMP-XXX
**Type:** [Feature Enhancement | Bug Fix | Performance | UX Improvement]
**Priority:** [High | Medium | Low]
**Status:** Identified
**Date:** 2024-12-09

---

## Opportunity

**What are we improving?**

Example:
"Feature X has low engagement (15% usage) and high drop-off (40%).
User feedback indicates confusion about how to use it."

**Why does this matter?**

Example:
"Feature X is a core value proposition. Low usage means users
aren't getting full value from the product. This impacts
retention and satisfaction."

---

## Data

**Analytics:**
- Feature X usage: 15% (target: 60%)
- Drop-off at Feature X: 40%
- Time spent: 30 seconds (too short)

**User Feedback:**
- "I don't understand how to use Feature X" (12 mentions)
- "Feature X seems broken" (3 mentions)

**Hypothesis:**
Users don't understand how to use Feature X because there's
no onboarding or guidance.

---

## Proposed Solution

**What will we change?**

Example:
"Add inline onboarding to Feature X:
- Tooltip on first use explaining purpose
- Step-by-step guide for first action
- Success celebration when completed
- Help button for future reference"

**Expected Impact:**
- Feature X usage: 15% → 60%
- Drop-off: 40% → 10%
- User satisfaction: +1.5 points

---

## Effort Estimate

**Design:** 1 day
**Implementation:** 1 day
**Testing:** 0.5 days
**Total:** 2.5 days

---

## Success Metrics

**How will we measure success?**
- Feature X usage > 60% (within 2 weeks)
- Drop-off < 10%
- User feedback mentions decrease
- Support tickets about Feature X decrease

---

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Design + Implement + Test
**Week 2:** Monitor impact

---

## Next Steps

1. Design inline onboarding (Step 03)
2. Create Design Delivery (Step 04)
3. Hand off to BMad (Step 05)
4. Validate implementation (Step 06)
5. Monitor impact (Step 07)

Example:
"- Clarify value prop on welcome screen
- Simplify family concept explanation
- Make dog addition optional
- Add progress indicators
- Add celebration on completion"
```
