# Test Quality Review - Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to validate that the test quality review workflow completed successfully and all quality criteria were properly evaluated.

---

## Prerequisites

Note: `test-review` is optional and only audits existing tests; it does not generate tests.
Coverage analysis is out of scope for this workflow. Use `trace` for coverage metrics and coverage gate decisions.

### Test File Discovery

- [ ] Test file(s) identified for review (single/directory/suite scope)
- [ ] Test files exist and are readable
- [ ] Test framework detected (Playwright, Jest, Cypress, Vitest, etc.)
- [ ] Test framework configuration found (playwright.config.ts, jest.config.js, etc.)

### Knowledge Base Loading

- [ ] tea-index.csv loaded successfully
- [ ] `test-quality.md` loaded (Definition of Done)
- [ ] `fixture-architecture.md` loaded (Pure function → Fixture patterns)
- [ ] `network-first.md` loaded (Route intercept before navigate)
- [ ] `data-factories.md` loaded (Factory patterns)
- [ ] `test-levels-framework.md` loaded (E2E vs API vs Component vs Unit)

- [ ] Violation breakdown by criterion recorded

**Score Calculation:**

- [ ] Starting score: 100
- [ ] Critical violations deducted (-10 each)
- [ ] High violations deducted (-5 each)

- [ ] Final score calculated: max(0, min(100, Starting - Violations + Bonus))

**Quality Grade:**

- [ ] Grade assigned based on score:
  - 90-100: A+ (Excellent)
  - 80-89: A (Good)
  - 70-79: B (Acceptable)
  - 60-69: C (Needs Improvement)

## Quality Checks

### Knowledge-Based Validation
