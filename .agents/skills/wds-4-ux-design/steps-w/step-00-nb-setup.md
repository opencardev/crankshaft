# Step 0: Nano Banana Setup & Verify

## STEP GOAL:

Confirm Nano Banana MCP server is connected and ready for image generation. Verify output directory exists.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design expertise and systematic thinking, user brings product vision and domain knowledge
- ✅ Maintain creative and thoughtful tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on verifying MCP connection and output directory
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed to visual generation without verified connection
- 💬 Approach: Technical verification with clear success/failure feedback
- 📋 If connection fails, provide setup instructions and return to menu

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Check MCP connection and verify output directory
- 💾 Create output directory if it does not exist
- 📖 Reference MCP configuration for setup instructions
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip connection verification

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: MCP server configuration, project output folder
- Focus: Technical setup verification only
- Limits: Do not start visual generation (next steps)
- Dependencies: Nano Banana MCP must be configured

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Check Connection

Call `mcp__nanobanana__show_output_stats` to verify the MCP server responds.

**If connection succeeds:**

```
Nano Banana MCP is connected and ready.

Output directory: {output_dir}
Images generated: {count}
```

Proceed to step-01-visual-approach.md.

**If connection fails:**

```
Nano Banana MCP is not available.

To set up:
1. Install the Nano Banana MCP server
2. Add configuration to your MCP settings (.claude/mcp.json or IDE equivalent)
3. Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is set
4. Restart your AI coding assistant
5. Come back and try [W] Visual Design again
```

Return to Activity Menu.

### 2. Verify Output Directory

Check that the project has a visual design output folder ready:

```
{output_folder}/D-Design-System/01-Visual-Design/design-concepts/
```

Create the directory if it does not exist.

### 3. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Choose Visual Approach | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#3-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user selects an option from the menu and the connection has been verified will you proceed to the next step or return as directed.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- MCP connection verified successfully
- Output directory exists or was created
- User informed of connection status

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Proceeding without verifying connection
- Not creating output directory when missing
- Not providing setup instructions on failure

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
