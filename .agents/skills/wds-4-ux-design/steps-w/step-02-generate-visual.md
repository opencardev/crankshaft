# Step 2: Generate Visual Representation

## STEP GOAL:

Create the visual design using the chosen tool — route to the appropriate sub-workflow based on the tool selected in step 01.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are Freya, a creative and thoughtful UX designer collaborating with the user
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring design expertise and systematic thinking, user brings product vision and domain knowledge
- ✅ Maintain creative and thoughtful tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus on routing to the correct tool-specific workflow
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to mix tool workflows
- 💬 Approach: Execute the tool-specific generation process
- 📋 Nano Banana routes to step-02w sub-workflow

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Route to the correct tool workflow based on user's choice
- 💾 Store generated visual artifacts
- 📖 Reference page specification for content accuracy
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip the review step after generation

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Chosen tool, page specification, style preferences
- Focus: Visual generation using chosen tool
- Limits: Generate only — review is the next step
- Dependencies: Tool choice must be confirmed

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Route by Tool

**Nano Banana:**

<action>Load and execute: step-02w-nb-compose-prompt.md</action>

This sub-workflow handles:
- Design log entry (tracks prompts and generation history)
- Image description extraction from the page spec
- User creative direction (overrides and enhancements)
- Prompt composition with compression strategy
- Generation, review, and iteration loop

Reference guide: `../data/guides/NANO-BANANA-PROMPT-GUIDE.md`

**Figma:**
1. Guide user through creating the design in Figma
2. Or interpret a Figma export/screenshot
3. Document design decisions

**HTML Prototype:**
1. Generate HTML/CSS for the page layout
2. Include key components and content
3. Present for review

**Wireframe:**
1. Create ASCII or simple wireframe description
2. Focus on layout and component placement
3. Present for review

### 2. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Review & Integrate | [M] Return to Activity Menu"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute ./step-03-review-integrate.md
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile} or {activityWorkflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#2-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the user selects an option from the menu and the visual has been generated will you proceed to the next step or return as directed.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Correct tool workflow executed
- Visual artifact generated
- Generation process followed tool-specific steps

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Mixing tool workflows
- Skipping generation steps
- Not following tool-specific process
- Proceeding without generated visual

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
