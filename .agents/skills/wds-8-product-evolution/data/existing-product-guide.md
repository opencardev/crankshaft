# Phase 8: Product Evolution

**Jump into an existing product to make strategic improvements**

---

## 🔑 Key Point: You Still Create a Project Brief!

**Brownfield projects (existing products) still need a Project Brief - just adapted to focus on:**

- ✅ The strategic challenge you're solving
- ✅ The scope of changes
- ✅ Success criteria
- ✅ Constraints

**You're not skipping Phase 1 - you're adapting it to the existing product context.**

---

## Two Entry Points to WDS

### **Entry Point 1: New Product (Phases 1-7) - Greenfield + Kaikaku**

Starting from scratch, designing complete user flows

**Terminology:**

- **Greenfield:** Building from scratch with no existing constraints
- **Kaikaku (改革):** Revolutionary change, complete transformation

### **Entry Point 2: Existing Product (Phase 8) - Brownfield + Kaizen**

Jumping into an existing product to make strategic changes

**Terminology:**

- **Brownfield:** Working within existing system and constraints
- **Kaizen (改善):** Continuous improvement, small incremental changes

**This phase is for:**

- Existing products that need strategic improvements
- Products where you're brought in as a "linchpin designer"
- Situations where you're not designing complete flows from scratch
- Making targeted changes to existing screens and features

---

## Purpose

When joining an existing product, you:

1. Focus on strategic challenges (not complete redesign)
2. Make targeted improvements to existing screens
3. Add new features incrementally
4. Package changes as Design Deliveries (small scope)
5. Work within existing constraints

**This is a different workflow** - you're not designing complete flows, you're making critical updates to an existing system.

## Project Setup: Choosing Your Entry Point

**During project initialization, you'll be asked:**

```
Which type of project are you working on?

1. New Product
   → Start with Phase 1 (Project Brief)
   → Design complete user flows from scratch
   → Full WDS workflow (Phases 1-7)

2. Existing Product
   → Start with Phase 8 (Product Evolution)
   → Make strategic improvements to existing product
   → Focused on critical updates, not complete redesign
```

**If you choose "Existing Product" (Brownfield):**

- **Phase 1 (Project Brief):** Adapted - focus on strategic challenge, not full vision
- **Phase 2 (Trigger Map):** Optional - print out focused trigger map if needed
- **Phase 3 (Platform Requirements):** Skip - tech stack already decided
- **Phase 4-5:** Adapted - update existing screens, not complete flows
- **Handover & Testing:** Same - deliveries (Phase 4 [H]) and validation (Phase 5 [T]) work the same way

---

## Step 01: Project Brief (Adapted for Brownfield)

**IMPORTANT: You still create a Project Brief - just adapted to the existing product context.**

**Brownfield vs Greenfield:**

- **Greenfield (New Product):** Full Project Brief covering vision, goals, stakeholders, constraints
- **Brownfield (Existing Product):** Focused Project Brief covering the strategic challenge and scope

**You're not skipping the Project Brief - you're adapting it to focus on:**

### **The Strategic Challenge**

```markdown
# Limited Project Brief: Existing Product

## Strategic Challenge

What specific problem are we solving?

Example:
"User onboarding has 60% drop-off rate. Users don't understand
the family concept and abandon during setup."

## Why WDS Designer?

Why bring in a linchpin designer now?

Example:
"We need expert UX design to redesign the onboarding flow and
improve completion rates to 80%+."

## Scope

What are we changing?

Example:
"Redesign onboarding flow (4 screens):

- Welcome screen (update copy and visuals)
- Family setup (simplify and clarify)
- Dog addition (make it optional for MVP)
- Success state (add celebration)"

## Success Criteria

How will we measure success?

Example:
"- Onboarding completion rate > 80%

- Time to complete < 2 minutes
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5"

## Constraints

What can't we change?

Example:
"- Tech stack: React Native + Supabase (already built)

- Brand: Colors and logo are fixed
- Timeline: 2 weeks to design + implement
- Scope: Only onboarding, don't touch other features"
```

---

## Step 02: Existing Context

**Upload and review existing materials:**

### **Business Goals**

```
Upload: business-goals.pdf
Review: What's the company trying to achieve?
```

### **Target Group Material**

```
Upload: user-personas.pdf
Upload: user-research.pdf
Review: Who are the users? What do they need?
```

### **Print Out Trigger Map**

```
Based on existing materials, create a focused trigger map:
- What triggers bring users to this feature?
- What outcomes are they seeking?
- What's currently failing?
```

**Example (Focused Trigger Map):**

```markdown
# Trigger Map: Onboarding Improvement

## Trigger Moment

User downloads app and opens it for the first time

## Current Experience

1. Welcome screen (confusing value prop)
2. Login/Signup choice (too many options)
3. Family setup (unclear what "family" means)
4. Dog addition (forced, feels like homework)
5. 60% drop off before reaching dashboard

## Desired Outcome

User understands value, completes setup, reaches dashboard

## Barriers

- Unclear value proposition
- "Family" concept is confusing
- Forced dog addition feels like work
- No sense of progress or achievement

## Solution Focus

- Clarify value prop on welcome screen
- Simplify family concept explanation
- Make dog addition optional
- Add progress indicators and celebration
```

### **Understand Existing Product**

```
Review:
- Current app (use it yourself)
- Existing design system (if any)
- Technical constraints
- User feedback and analytics
```

---

## Step 03: Critical Updates (Not Complete Flows)

**Key difference: You're updating existing screens, not designing from scratch**

### **Example: Onboarding Improvement**

**Scenario 01: Welcome Screen (Update)**

```markdown
# Scenario 01: Welcome Screen (UPDATE)

## What's Changing

- Clearer value proposition
- Better visual hierarchy
- Stronger call-to-action

## What's Staying

- Brand colors
- Logo placement
- Screen structure

## Design Updates

- Hero image: Show family using app together
- Headline: "Keep your family's dog care organized"
- Subheadline: "Share tasks, track routines, never miss a walk"
- CTA: "Get Started" (larger, more prominent)

## Components

- Existing: Button (Primary)
- Update: Hero Image component
- Update: Typography (larger headline)
```

**Scenario 02: Family Setup (Redesign)**

```markdown
# Scenario 02: Family Setup (REDESIGN)

## Current Problem

Users don't understand what "family" means in this context

## Solution

- Rename "Family" to "Household"
- Add explanation: "Who helps take care of your dog?"
- Show examples: "You, your partner, your kids, your dog walker"
- Make it visual: Show avatars of household members

## Design Changes

- Screen title: "Set up your household"
- Explanation text (new)
- Visual examples (new)
- Simplified form (fewer fields)

## Components

- Existing: Input (Text)
- New: Explanation Card component
- New: Avatar Grid component
```

**Scenario 03: Dog Addition (Make Optional)**

```markdown
# Scenario 03: Dog Addition (MAKE OPTIONAL)

## Current Problem

Forcing users to add a dog feels like homework, causes drop-off

## Solution

- Make it optional for onboarding
- Show value: "Add your first dog to get started"
- Allow skip: "I'll do this later"
- Celebrate if they add: "Great! Let's meet [dog name]!"

## Design Changes

- Add "Skip for now" button
- Add celebration animation if dog added
- Update copy to be inviting, not demanding

## Components

- Existing: Button (Primary, Secondary)
- New: Celebration Animation component
```

**Notice the difference:**

- ❌ Not designing complete flows from scratch
- ✅ Updating existing screens strategically
- ✅ Focused on solving specific problems
- ✅ Working within existing constraints

---

## What Triggers a Design Delivery?

### **Accumulated Changes**

**Small changes accumulate:**

- Bug fix: Button alignment
- Refinement: Improved error message
- Enhancement: New filter option
- Fix: Loading state missing
- Improvement: Better empty state

**When enough changes accumulate:**

```
10-15 small changes = Design Delivery
OR
3-5 medium features = Design Delivery
OR
1 major feature = Design Delivery
```

### **Business Triggers**

**Scheduled releases:**

- Monthly updates
- Quarterly feature releases
- Annual major versions

**Market triggers:**

- Competitor feature launched
- User demand spike
- Business opportunity

**Technical triggers:**

**Track in backlog:**

```
Backlog:
- [ ] Bug: Login button misaligned on iPad
- [ ] Enhancement: Add "Remember me" checkbox
- [ ] Feature: Social login (Google, Apple)
- [ ] Refinement: Improve onboarding copy
- [ ] Fix: Loading spinner not showing
```

---

### Step 2: Prioritize Changes

**Criteria:**

- **Impact:** High user value vs low effort
- **Urgency:** Critical bugs vs nice-to-haves
- **Alignment:** Strategic goals vs random requests
- **Feasibility:** Quick wins vs complex changes

**Prioritized list:**

```
High Priority (Next Update):
1. Bug: Login button misaligned (Critical)
2. Fix: Loading spinner not showing (High)
3. Enhancement: Add "Remember me" (Medium)

Medium Priority (Future Update):
4. Feature: Social login (Medium)
5. Refinement: Improve copy (Low)

Low Priority (Backlog):
6. Enhancement: Dark mode (Low)
```

---

### Step 3: Design Changes

**Return to Phase 4-5:**

- Design fixes and refinements
- Create specifications for new features
- Update design system if needed

## The Sunset Ride 🌅

**After establishing the ongoing cycle:**

```
Designer: "We've launched v1.0, iterated through v1.1 and v1.2,
           and now v2.0 is live. The product is mature, the
           process is smooth, and users are happy.

           The design-to-development workflow is humming along
           beautifully. We're a well-oiled machine!"

Developer: "Agreed! We've found our rhythm. Design Deliveries
            come in, we implement them, you validate, we ship.
            The 3 touch points work perfectly.

            Users love the product, stakeholders are happy,
            and we're continuously improving."

Designer: "Ready to ride into the sunset?"

Developer: "Let's go! 🌅"

[Designer and Developer ride off into the sunset together]
