### Role-Based Content

- [ ] QA examples present (practical testing focus)
- [ ] Dev examples present (integration/TDD focus)
- [ ] Lead examples present (architecture/patterns focus)
- [ ] VP examples present (strategy/metrics focus)

### Quiz Quality

- [ ] Questions test understanding, not memorization
- [ ] 3-5 questions per session
- [ ] Mix of difficulty levels
- [ ] Clear correct answers with explanations

---

## Error Handling

- [ ] Corrupted progress file detection
- [ ] Backup and recovery options
- [ ] Missing TEA docs fallback (Web-Browsing)
- [ ] Quiz failure recovery (review or continue)
- [ ] Session interruption handling (auto-save)

---

## User Experience

- [ ] Clear navigation instructions
- [ ] Progress visibility (completion percentage, next recommended)
- [ ] Auto-save after each session
- [ ] Resume capability works seamlessly
- [ ] Exit options clear at all decision points

---

## State Management

- [ ] stepsCompleted array updated correctly
- [ ] Session tracking accurate (status, dates, scores)
- [ ] Completion percentage calculated correctly
- [ ] Next recommended session logic works
- [ ] lastStep and lastContinued timestamps updated

---

## Validation Mode

- [ ] **step-v-01-validate.md** checks all quality standards
- [ ] Generates validation report
- [ ] Identifies issues clearly
- [ ] Provides remediation suggestions

---

## Edit Mode

- [ ] **step-e-01-assess-workflow.md** identifies what to edit
- [ ] **step-e-02-apply-edits.md** applies modifications safely
- [ ] Preserves workflow integrity during edits

---

## Documentation

- [ ] Progress file writes efficient

---

## Security

- [ ] Progress files private to user
- [ ] No sensitive data in session notes

---
