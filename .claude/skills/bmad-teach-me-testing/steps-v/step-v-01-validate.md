**Report saved:** {validationReport}

{If PASS:}
✅ **Workflow is ready for production!**

{If FAIL:}
❌ **Issues found that need fixing.**
See report for details: {validationReport}

{If WARNINGS:}
⚠️ **Minor issues found.**
Workflow is usable but could be improved.

**Validation report generated.**"

**This is the final validation step - workflow ends here.**

---

## 🚨 SUCCESS METRICS

✅ All validation checks run, comprehensive report generated, issues identified with remediation guidance, overall status determined.

**Master Rule:** Check everything systematically, report findings clearly, provide actionable remediation.

## On Complete

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow.on_complete`

If the resolver succeeds and returns a non-empty `workflow.on_complete`, execute that value as the final terminal instruction before exiting.

If the resolver fails, returns no output, or resolves an empty value, skip the hook and exit normally.
