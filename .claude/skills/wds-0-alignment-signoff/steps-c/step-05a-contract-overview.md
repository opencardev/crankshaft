### Role Reinforcement:

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 📋 Sets clear expectations and context for the contract

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Build Section 1: Project Overview

**Section 1: Project Overview**

**Explain to user**: "This section establishes what the project is about. I'll pull the realization and recommended solution from your alignment document."

### 2. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to step-05b-contract-business-model"

#### Menu Handling Logic:
- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF M: Return to {workflowFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:
- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the Project Overview section is built and confirmed will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin the next step.
