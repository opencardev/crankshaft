```yaml
delivery:
  id: 'DD-XXX'
  name: '[Short descriptive name]'
  type: 'incremental_improvement' # vs "complete_flow" for new features
  scope: 'update' # vs "new" for new features
  version: 'v2.0'

# What's the improvement?
improvement:
  summary: |
    [2-3 sentence summary of what's changing and why]

    Example:
    "Adding inline onboarding to Feature X to improve user understanding
     and increase usage from 15% to 60%. Analytics show 40% drop-off due
     to confusion. This update adds tooltips, step-by-step guidance, and
     success celebration."

  problem: |
    [What problem does this solve?]

    Example:
    "Feature X has low engagement (15% usage) and high drop-off (40%).
     User feedback indicates confusion about how to use it. 12 support
     tickets mention 'I don't understand Feature X'."

  solution: |
    [What's the solution?]

    Example:
    "Add inline onboarding that appears on first use:
     - Tooltip explaining Feature X purpose
     - Step-by-step guide for first action
     - Success celebration when completed
     - Help button for future reference"

  expected_impact: |
    [What will improve?]

    Example:
    "- Feature X usage: 15% → 60%
     - Drop-off: 40% → 10%
     - Support tickets: -80%
     - User satisfaction: +1.5 points"
