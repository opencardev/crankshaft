# Freya's Meta Content Guide

**When to load:** When specifying public pages that will appear in search results or be shared on social media

---

## Core Principle

**Every public page needs meta content for search results and social sharing.**

Meta content is not just SEO - it's essential page content that appears when users:
- Find your page in Google search results
- Share your page on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn
- Bookmark your page in their browser

---

## When to Collect Meta Content

### Public Pages (Always Required)
- Landing pages
- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- Product pages
- About/Contact pages
- Any page accessible without login

### Private/Authenticated Pages (Browser Tab Only)
- Dashboard pages
- Settings pages
- User profile pages
- Admin pages
- Any page requiring authentication

---

## Meta Content Components

### 1. Page Title (Browser Tab & Search Results)

**Purpose:** Appears in browser tab, search results, and social media shares

**Character Limit:** 55-60 characters (including brand name)

**Best Practices:**
- Front-load important keywords
- Include brand name at end (if space allows)
- Be descriptive and specific
- Make it compelling for clicks

**Agent Questions:**
```
"What should appear in the browser tab and search results for this page?"
"Keep it under 60 characters and make it descriptive."
"Example: 'Dog Walking Coordination - Dog Week' (42 chars)"
```

**Example:**
```markdown
### Page Title (Browser Tab & Search Results)
**Character Limit:** 55-60 characters

**Content:**
- EN: "Dog Walking Coordination - Dog Week"
- SE: "Hundpromenad Koordinering - Dog Week"
```

### 2. Meta Description (Search Results Preview)

**Purpose:** Appears below page title in search results

**Character Limit:** 150-160 characters

**Best Practices:**
- Summarize page value clearly
- Include call-to-action
- Use active voice
- Address user pain point or benefit
- Don't just repeat page title

**Agent Questions:**
```
"How would you describe this page in 150-160 characters to encourage clicks from search results?"
"What value does this page provide to users?"
"What action should they take?"
```

**Example:**
```markdown
### Meta Description (Search Results Preview)
**Character Limit:** 150-160 characters

**Content:**
- EN: "Coordinate dog walks with your family. Never miss a walk again. Simple scheduling, automatic reminders, and family accountability. Start free today."

**Character Limit:** 60-70 characters

**Best Practices:**

**Agent Questions:**
```
"What title would work best when this page is shared on social media?"

```

**Example:**
```markdown
#### Social Media Title
**Character Limit:** 60-70 characters

**Content:**

## Agent Workflow for Public Pages

### Step 1: Identify Page Visibility

Ask: "Is this page publicly accessible (no login required)?"

- **Yes** → Collect all meta content
- **No** → Only collect browser tab title

---

### Step 2: Collect Page Title

**Question:**
```
"What should appear in the browser tab and search results for this page?
Keep it under 60 characters and make it descriptive.

Example: 'Dog Walking Coordination - Dog Week' (42 chars)

Your page title:"
```

**Validate:**
- Length ≤ 60 characters
- Descriptive and specific
- Includes brand name (if space)

---

### Step 3: Collect Meta Description

**Question:**
```
"How would you describe this page in 150-160 characters to encourage clicks from search results?

What value does this page provide?
What action should users take?

Your meta description:"
```

**Validate:**
- Length 150-160 characters
- Includes value proposition
- Has call-to-action
- Not just repeating title

---

### Step 4: Collect Social Media Title

**Question:**
```
"What title would work best when this page is shared on social media?

Can be different from page title, optimized for engagement.
Think: What would make someone click in their feed?

Your social media title:"
```

**Validate:**
- Length 60-70 characters
- Engaging and conversational
- Creates curiosity or shows benefit

---

### Step 5: Collect Social Media Description

**Question:**
```
"What description would encourage clicks when shared on Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn?

Keep it under 150 characters and make it engaging.

Your social media description:"
```

**Validate:**
- Length 120-150 characters
- Casual and engaging tone
- Shows clear benefit

---

### Step 6: Specify Social Media Image

**Question:**
```
"What image best represents this page content?

Should be 1200x630px and visually engaging.
Options: Product screenshot, hero image, custom graphic

Image description:"
```

**Document:**
- Image path
- Alt text in all languages
- Image requirements

---

## Multi-Language Considerations

**All meta content must be provided in all product languages.**

**Translation Tips:**
- Character limits apply to each language
- Some languages are more verbose (German, Swedish)
- May need to adjust wording to fit limits
- Maintain same tone and message across languages

**Example:**
```markdown
**Content:**
- EN: "Never Forget a Dog Walk Again" (32 chars)
- SE: "Glöm Aldrig en Hundpromenad Igen" (34 chars) ← Slightly longer, still fits
```

```

---

```

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Same Content Everywhere

```

**Right:**
```
Page Title: "Dog Walking Coordination - Dog Week"
Social Title: "Never Forget a Dog Walk Again 🐕" ← Optimized for social
```
